### This short document explains the structure of the code and scripts####

There are three sections:

1. pre-processing: In this the data from buoys and the different models (ERA5, gtsm, etc) are processed.
A folder names "generated data" is created to store all the processes data in the form of an excel file named "Pos_VelData.xlsx" for each individual buoy.

2. Model: This includes scripts to run the model on the pre-processed data available in "Pos_VelData.xlsx"". The data generated is stored in the respective buoy folder. Further, for each buoy based on the forces in the model a new folder is created. For example: "h1f1A1T1O1Po1Pt1"
Here, 'h' is for ice thickness, and following '1' corresponds to the thickness in m . 'f' is for Coriolis and following '1' implies the force is on or active. Incase coriolis is switched off, then '0' follows 'f'. Now similarly, 'A' is for wind/air stress, 'T' is for tidal shear stress, 'O' is for 
ocean shear stress. 'Po' is for pressure gradients from ocean sea surface heights and 'Pt' for pressure gradients from tidal sea surface heights.
Under each of such folder you will find an excel file including all the simulated model data with certain important statistics.

Please note that 1 and 2 are independent set of scripts. One doesn't have to run pre-processing everytime. It just needs to be run once to create the pos_veldata.xlsx file. 

3. Post-processing: This includes scripts for plotting and saving basic figures. Further, there are jupyter scripts to postprocess the data.
